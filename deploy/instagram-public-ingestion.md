# Account-independent Instagram collection

The scheduled pipeline uses `scripts/instagram_public_fetcher.py`, following
[Chumei's Instagram ingestion design](https://github.com/skyhong2002/chumei/blob/main/docs/instagram-ingestion.md).
It does not read an Instagram cookie or call the old Instaloader helpers.
Profile and Story source IDs remain unchanged, preserving deduplication.

- Stories: `intropix/instagram-stories-scraper`, using only this site's configured
  Apify credential. Only the public organization and professional creator accounts
  already in the directory are targets; mentions are never added as targets.
- Profiles: the logged-out Instagram endpoint first, with a separate 24-hour
  cooldown after refusal. A small `apify/instagram-profile-scraper` fallback is
  available above a US$1 reserve for Stories and Facebook.
- Both collectors run at most once per three hours, even when the fast pipeline
  runs every 30 minutes. Individual sources have adaptive 12–336 hour intervals
  (Stories capped at 168 hours). Never-checked accounts rotate first, ordered by
  their observed publishing cadence. A limited budget cannot cover every account
  within 24 hours; the status page reports actual coverage.

The state is `state/instagram_public.json`. Successful network attempts are
recorded there. The social watchdog reads that cache without making new IG
requests or claiming another successful fetch. Retired Instaloader state stays
on disk as history and does not govern the new collectors.

## Credit and execution guards

`HARMONICA_APIFY_MONTHLY_BUDGET_USD` limits total remote account usage, including
Facebook. The limit defaults to US$4; the operator approved US$5 from existing
free credit on 2026-09-18. The effective ceiling never exceeds the account's
reported limit. No code purchases credit or changes the Apify subscription.
Only this project's configured credential is read; Chumei contributor tokens
are not imported.

Instagram receives at most half of evenly paced remaining credit each UTC day,
capped at US$0.20/day. The rest remains available to Facebook. Each Story run
scans at most 10 accounts, returns at most 10 items and observes a 40-item daily
limit. A billable request reserves its worst-case cost and result count on disk
before submission and sets Apify's `maxTotalChargeUsd`. Unknown outcomes keep
their reservation. Apify balance failures stop paid work. Manual runs use the
same pipeline lock; `--pipeline-lock-held` is reserved for the pipeline child.

The actor's `OUTPUT` record distinguishes genuinely empty results from denial
and partial scans. Unattempted accounts remain due. Daily allowance denial
retries after UTC midnight; provider capacity denial retries after one hour.
Images are cached immediately; videos receive a cached first-frame preview.
Expired Stories are filtered before ingest and again by the homepage.

## Operations

```sh
python3 scripts/build_social_sources.py
python3 scripts/instagram_public_fetcher.py --kind story
python3 scripts/run_pipeline.py --skip-youtube --skip-facebook --skip-llm-tags --publish-pages
```

Use `--accounts username1,username2` to select directory accounts for a smoke
test. This does not bypass credit limits, source due times or provider cooldowns.
Use `--skip-instagram` on the pipeline when only rebuilding an existing cache.
The Instaloader/bootstrap scripts remain available for historical diagnostics;
refreshing a maintainer login is no longer a recovery step for scheduled work.

Verify `api/status.json` → `components[id=instagram].stories` and `profiles`
separately, then `api/latest.json` for current `story_expires_at` values and
cached `/assets/feed-images/` URLs. A zero error count alone is not evidence of
successful collection.
